Check your affordability and minimise the housing loan amount and repayment period to save interest costs.\n\n\nIf the cash outlay to buy a flat and the monthly housing loan instalments are too much of a financial burden, it may be better to give yourself more time to build up your finances before committing to buy a flat.

This means that you may need to use more cash to meet future loan instalments.  Hence, consider paying in cash upfront to reduce the loan amount required to give yourself more flexibility to deal with emergencies and future expenses. You can also save on interest payments by taking a smaller housing loan amount or shorter loan period. |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Choose a shorter repayment period** | A longer repayment period means that the mortgage loan amount will be repaid at a slower pace and more interests will have to be paid. Opting for a shorter loan repayment period is more prudent as there is a shorter period of exposure to fluctuations in loan interest rates, incomes and expenses, etc. In addition, you will also save on the interest payments. Target to pay off your mortgage loan as soon as possible so that you can start saving more for retirement. It may be a stretch if you are paying off your mortgage loan and preparing for retirement at the same time. |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n##### NEXT STEPS\n\n\n* ##### [Housing Loan Options](/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options)\n\n\n\n[Understand the different terms and considerations between taking a housing loan from HDB and the financial institutions, for an informed financing decision.](/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options)\n* ##### [Application for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) Letter](/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter)\n\n\n[Find out more about the HFE letter and how to apply for one to confirm your eligibility.

The remaining balance in the CPF OA must be used to pay for the flat purchase, before they can take an HDB housing loan. If you need the CPF refund from the sale of your current property to finance the resale flat purchase, please ensure the amount has already been credited to your CPF OA, before you submit the resale application.\n\n\nYou should also take note of the following conditions for using your CPF savings:\n\n\n* There is a limit on the total amount of CPF savings that can be used for your flat purchase. Once that limit is reached, you will not be able to withdraw more of your CPF savings and have to pay the balance flat purchase price and/ or monthly mortgage instalments in cash\n* The total amount of CPF savings that can be used for your flat purchase and/ or paying monthly mortgage instalments will depend on the extent the remaining lease of the flat can cover the youngest buyer up to the age of 95\\. You can get the details of a flat's lease at [HDB Map Services](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/fi10/emap.html). Details on the use of CPF savings and the applicable limits are shown in the table below:\n \n\n| Remaining lease of flat is at least 20 years and can cover the youngest buyer up to the age of 95 | Applicable Limits for CPF Usage |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yes | The amount use is capped at the lower of the value of flat or price of the flat at the time of purchase. |\n| No | The amount is pro\\-rated based on the extent the remaining lease of the flat can cover the youngest buyer up to the age of 95\\. When the allowed CPF amount is used up, buyers have to pay the balance flat purchase price and/ or monthly mortgage instalments in cash. This will help buyers to set aside CPF savings for their housing needs during retirement (e.g. buying a replacement property). |\n\n\nFor information on the use of CPF savings, you may use the CPF Board's [online calculator](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/tools-and-services/calculators/cpf-housing-usage).

This is a contractual term between you and the sellers. Once it is agreed upon, it may be varied only with mutual consent. Please submit the resale application as soon as possible to minimise unforeseeable changes, e.g. EIP and SPR quotas, untoward events, etc. |\n| **Extension of stay** | To ease sellers\u2019 transition to their next home, sellers may arrange with you to extend their stay temporarily in the flat, for up to 3 months after the resale completion. The [temporary extension of stay](/residential/selling-a-flat/resale-application/request-for-temporary-extension-of-stay) is subject to your agreement.

In addition, non\\-Malaysian SPR households must meet the SPR quota.\n\n\nYou may be eligible to buy a flat if:\n\n\n* You and the flat seller are of the same ethnic group and household citizenship; or\n* After your flat purchase, the number of households of your ethnic group remains within the block and neighbourhood limits. In addition, for non\\-Malaysian SPR households, the number of SPR households remains within the SPR quota.\n\n\nCheck your eligibility\n----------------------\n\n\nYou may use our [e\\-Service](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB29ETHN/BB29STREET) to check if you are eligible to buy an HDB resale flat in a particular block or neighbourhood under the EIP/ SPR quota. The prevailing EIP and SPR quotas for the month are also displayed on the resale flat listings on the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/finding-a-flat). The quotas are updated on the 1st of each month.\n\n\nPlease check to ensure compliance with the EIP/ SPR quota at each of the following milestones:\n\n\n* Flat sellers grant the Option to Purchase (OTP);\n* You exercise the OTP; and\n* You and the flat sellers submit the respective portion of the resale application.\n\n\n\\* A resale application is completed only when HDB receives both the buyers\u2019 and sellers\u2019 portions of the resale application and the necessary supporting documents.\n\n\nAbout the EIP\n-------------\n\n\nThe EIP is put in place to preserve Singapore\u2019s multi\\-cultural identity and promote racial integration and harmony. It ensures that there is a balanced mix of the various ethnic communities in HDB towns. The EIP limits are set at block and neighbourhood levels based on the ethnic make\\-up of Singapore.\n\n\nFor the purchase of an HDB flat, a household with members of different ethnic groups may choose to classify their household ethnicity under the ethnicity of any buyer(s) or spouse according to the race shown on their NRIC.\n\n\nOnce an ethnicity is chosen for the household, it will remain the same when the flat owners subsequently sell their flat on the open market.\n\n\nAbout the SPR quota\n-------------------\n\n\nThe SPR quota ensures that SPR families can better integrate into the local community. Malaysians are excluded from this quota because of their close cultural and historical similarities with Singaporeans. Non\\-Malaysian SPR households applying to buy an HDB resale flat need to be within the SPR quota for the block (8%) and neighbourhood (5%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"page_url": "https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/planning-considerations/conversion-scheme-application-procedure", "page_text": "\nConversion of Adjoining Flats Scheme\n====================================\n\n\n\n\nIf you and your family intend to buy adjoining flats that are 3\\-room or smaller and convert them into 1 unit under the Conversion of Adjoining Flats Scheme, you have to meet the eligibility conditions and adhere to the conditions after purchasing the converted flat.
