    Welcome to the HDB Resale Buddy, your AI-Assistant for all your HDB resale buying enquiries. This application comprises two main features:

    ### Resale Q&A Buddy
    The Resale Q&A Buddy is designed to assist you with queries related to buying a resale HDB flat in Singapore. 
    
    Using data directly sourced from the [official HDB website](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/), it can answer questions about the resale procedure, financing options, eligibility, and other related topics. 
    
    For optimal results, provide specific and detailed queries related to procedures, rules, and official guidelines.

    ### Resale Price Buddy
    The Resale Price Buddy helps you query resale transaction price data for HDB flats in Singapore, based on data from 2017 onwards sourced from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg). 
    
    It can extract and understand key details from your queries, including specific towns, streets, blocks, flat types, storey ranges, and transaction months. 
    
    For best results, include as many details as possible about the flats you're interested in, such as street name, block number, town, flat type, storey range, or specific time periods.
